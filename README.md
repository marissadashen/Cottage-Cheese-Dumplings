# Cottage-Cheese-Dumplings

These tasty little dumplings are very easy to make. 


 
40 g butter

2 egg yolks

50 g breadcrumbs

80 g cottage cheese

1 teaspoon finely chopped basil

Salt, pepper, nutmeg
 

Cream the butter, and gradually add the egg yolks and bread crumbs.

Squeeze the cheese dry and add to the mixture. Add the basil.

Refrigerate for about an hour.

Form dumplings with a spoon and drop into salted boiling water. For a distictive quenelle shape, be sure to use spoons that are a little bit bigger than the size you want to create.

Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
